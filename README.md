# BG-flavoured markdown

Mardown BG (_.mdbg_) is an improvement of the existing [Mardown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language.

It provides nice features which make it possible to generate a fresh, correct and nice _.tex_ document.

## About

### Usage

You can install mdbg easily with pip :

```sh
pip install -e .
```

This will make the `mdbg` command available :

```sh
> mdbg
usage: main.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [-m | -b] [-T | -M | -H]
                      [--title TITLE] [--date DATE] [--author AUTHOR]
                      [--packages PACKAGES] [--documentclass DOCUMENTCLASS]
                      [--roboto] [--disabletoc] [--minted MINTED]
                      INPUT
```

To make things easier, you can create a bash function in your `~/.bash_profile` (for example) :

```sh
function cpbg {
	mdbg $1.mdbg --title="$2"
	lualatex --shell-escape $1.tex
	lualatex --shell-escape $1.tex
	rm $1.aux $1.log $1.out $1.toc rm $1.tex
	open $1.pdf
	}
```

### Atom packages

mdbg comes with Atom support with these two packages :

1. [language-mdbg](https://www.github.com/yopox/language-mdbg) provides syntax highlighting
2. [mdbg-snippets](https://www.github.com/yopox/mdbg-snippets) provides autocompletion

## Syntax

### Markdown-flavoured

#### Headers

Like in markdown.

```mdbg
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

##### Non numbered sections

For non enumerated sections :

```mdbg
#* H1
##* H2
###* H3
####* H4
#####* H5
######* H6
```


#### Emphasis

Translations :

##### Bold

In markdown :

```md
**bold** or __bold__
```

In mdbg :

```mdbg
*bold*
```

##### Underline

```mdbg
_underline_
```

##### Italic

In markdown :

```md
_italic_ or *italic*
```

In mdbg :

```mdbg
%italic%
```

##### Strikethrough

In markdown :

```md
~~strikethrough~~
```

In mdbg :

```mdbg
~strikethrough~
```

#### Lists

Small changes have been made.

This is a list in mdbg :

```mdbg
Neutral text :
    - first item
    - second item
        - first second item
        - second second item
    - third item
```

and an enumerated list :

```mdbg
    1. first item
    2. second item
        1. first second item
        2. second second item
    3. third item
```

The indentations can be four spaces or a tabulation but each item has to be idented.

#### Links

```mdbg
[text for link](https://www.google.com)

[text for link](https://www.google.com "title for link")
```

#### Code

Like in Markdown.

#### Tables

Like Markdown, without the 2nd line.

In mdbg :

```mdbg
| C11 | C21 | C31 |
| C21 | C22 | C32 |
| C31 | C32 | C33 |
```

Whereas in Markdown :

```md
| C11 | C21 | C31 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C21 | C22 | C32 |
| C31 | C32 | C33 |
```

You can't chose text alignment for every cell but you can chose it for every row by adding the command `!!tab` followed by the alignments.

For example one possible table would be :

```mdbg
!!tab r c l
| C11 | C21 | C31 |
| C21 | C22 | C32 |
| C31 | C32 | C33 |
```

### New !

#### Trees

##### Basic binary tree

Description :
  - Command : `![TREE]!`
  - Root : `R "text"`
  - Node : `N "text"`
  - Leaf : `L "text"`

```mdbg
![TREE R "root" N "a node" L "a leaf" L "an other leaf" N "an other node" L "a leaf again !" N "a node again !" L  "OneWord" L "the last leaf"]!
```

If you want to draw an non strictly binary tree, you can write `L ()` for an empty leaf

##### Non binary trees

Command : `![nTREE]!`

```mdbg
![nTREE "A" -- {"B" -- {"H" -- {"N", "O"}, "I", "J"}, "C", "D", "E" -- {"K" -- "P", "L" -- "Q"}, "F", "G" -- "M"}]!
```
#### Graphs

You can draw graphs with a very simple syntax (the same as nTREE syntax).

This is made possible thanks to _TikZ_ fantastic `graphs` and `graphdrawing` packages, with some of their libraries.

Command : `![GRAPH .............!]`

With a possible `!!option` before `![GRAPH...` line.

This `option` will be translated to `\graph[<option>]...` in _LaTeX_.

See pgfmanual for more information about the syntax.

You can also base your graph on the example given in the section **Examples**

#### New text features

##### Superscript

You can use text in superscript :

```mdbg
We live in Paris, in the 5^{th}
```

##### Subscript

You can use text in subscript :

```mdbg
This is a normal text_{this one is subscripted}
```

##### Footnotes

This is how to use footnotes :

```mdbg
I never work ***{almost}
```

##### Colored texts

How to use colored texts :

```mdbg
I love {red}[red] and {green}[blue witten in green] !
```

A list of all possible colors is given at the end of this readme.

#### Center environnement

You can center some text or some figure with this :
```mdbg
(((
...
)))
```

#### Miscellaneous

Add a `!` at the begining of a line to have a `\noindent` before this line in the _LaTeX_ generated file.

Add a `/` at the end of a line to have a line break.

## Examples

### Trees

The command `![TREE R 1 N 2 F 3 F 4 F 5]!` produces the following result in LaTeX :

![Binary tree](http://www.mirari.fr/ShRU)

the command `![nTREE A -- {B -- {H -- {N, O}, I, J}, C, D, E -- {K -- P, L -- Q}, F, G -- M}]!` produces the following result in LaTeX :

![Multiple tree](http://www.mirari.fr/fi6Z)

### Code

Those lines :
```md
```ocaml
let fg i = 2 * i + 1;;
let fd i = 2 * i + 2;;

let rec heapify a n i = match fg i, fd i with
	| g, d when g > n -> ()
	| g, d when d > n -> if a.(i) < a.(g) then swap a i g
	| g, d -> if a.(i) < a.(g) || a.(i) < a.(d) then begin let k = if a.(g) > a.(d) then g else d in swap a i k; heapify a n k end;;

let heap_sort a = let n = ref (vect_length a - 1) in
	for k = !n downto 0 do
		heapify a !n k
	done;
	while !n <> 0 do
		swap a 0 !n;
		decr n;
		heapify a !n 0
	done;;
```Â 
```

Will produce this :

### Graphs

```mdbg
!!layered layout
![GRAPH "5th Edition" -> { "6th Edition", "PWB 1.0" };
"6th Edition" -> { "LSX", "1 BSD", "Mini Unix", "Wollongong", "Interdata" };
"Interdata" -> { "Unix/TS 3.0", "PWB 2.0", "7th Edition" };
"7th Edition" -> { "8th Edition", "32V", "V7M", "Ultrix-11", "Xenix", "UniPlus+" };
"V7M" -> "Ultrix-11";
"8th Edition" -> "9th Edition";
"1 BSD" -> "2 BSD" -> "2.8 BSD" -> { "Ultrix-11", "2.9 BSD" };
"32V" -> "3 BSD" -> "4 BSD" -> "4.1 BSD" -> { "4.2 BSD", "2.8 BSD", "8th Edition" };
"4.2 BSD" -> { "4.3 BSD", "Ultrix-32" };
"PWB 1.0" -> { "PWB 1.2" -> "PWB 2.0", "USG 1.0" -> { "CB Unix 1", "USG 2.0" }};
"CB Unix 1" -> "CB Unix 2" -> "CB Unix 3" -> { "Unix/TS++", "PDP-11 Sys V" };
{ "USG 2.0" -> "USG 3.0", "PWB 2.0", "Unix/TS 1.0" } -> "Unix/TS 3.0";
{ "Unix/TS++", "CB Unix 3", "Unix/TS 3.0" } -> "TS 4.0" -> "System V.0" -> "System V.2" -> "System V.3";
]!
```

Will produce this :

## pgfmanual

[Here](http://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf) is a link of a recent and accurate version of pgf-tikz manual.

It is used for trees and graphs in Markdown BG.
